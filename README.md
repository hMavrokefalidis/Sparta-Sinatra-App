Sparta-Sinatra-App
For this project I was asked to build a simple CRUD application using the Sinatra framework,
within 8 hours managed to deliver an MVP that is able to store permanent data and perform all the CRUD core functionalities

Getting Started
To get started you can clone the project, make sure you have bundler installed, if bundler is not installed you can install it by executing (gem install bundler), then execute "bundle" in your terminal to install all the required gems of the project.

Finally execute "rackup" from your terminal and follow the localhost.portnumber(it should be specified on the terminal)

Using the software:

On the landing page you will be able to see all the elements of the database which you can simply edit, view or delete them by clicking the equivalent action. Then, from the navbar, you can either press the home link which will take you to the home screen and is going to follow you to every page, or add new vehicle which will navigate you through the process of adding a new element to the database and thus to the landing page.
